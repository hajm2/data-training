knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The Old Faithful data set contains the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

First load the data:

```{r}

df <- faithful

```

The data description is given in the table below.

|variable|description|
|eruptions|the duration of the eruption, minutes|
|waiting|waiting time to next eruption, minutes|

A summary of the distributions of each variable are as follows:

```{r summary}

summary(df)

```

bla bla bla

```{r histogram_eruptions}

hist(df$eruptions)

```

```{r histogram_waiting}

hist(df$waiting)

```

## Further work

A scatterplot

```{r furtherwork}

plot(df$eruption, df$waiting)

```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
